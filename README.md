# DataStructuresVB
.Net1 week 4

This was my third individual assignment for .NET I.

Here were the requirements for the assignment:

Design, implement, test, and debug a Visual BasicÂ® program to create an enhanced home utility auditing program based on Week Three.
 
The program should do the following:
 
The program must meet all the requirements for the Week 2 and Week 3 program.
Include a button labeled "Export". This must be in the Listing Area. It should export all the data from the datagridview control to an external text file.
When the program starts, it must automatically read a minimum of 20 appliances from a text file. These appliances must be included in the drop-down list for user selection - not automatically added to the datagridview.
Six of the appliances must be those specified in the Week 2 requirements.
These appliances will populate the drop-down list for appliance selection.
Make sure that if the appliance name has "Washer" in it then it will calculate the additional water cost properly.  There should be a minimum of (2) appliances with the word "Washer" in it (for example:   Dish Washer, Clothes Washer)
The text file must be submitted with your program. I recommend that it be located in the bin folder.
Use arrays or structures where applicable
 
Your name, date, project description and class must be in the code as comments (similar to an APA title page). This must be in the form that automatically loads when the program is executed.
 
Your project must be properly documented (describe the use of variables, describe how a function or routine works, use proper naming conventions for variables and labels).
